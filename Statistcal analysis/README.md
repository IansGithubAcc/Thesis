# The statistal analysis:
The entire analysis is done using one singular R file ("Scenario_creation.R"), which makes heavy use of the texmex package.

The file includes:
* General Pareto threshold selectrion and fitting
* Preliminary dependency analyses
* Estimation of 2 variable join exeedance curves
* Estimation of likeliest value for secondary variables

## Extra files:
Some extra Ipython files have been addes which were used for downloading and interpeting reanalysed ERA5 data.
