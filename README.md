# MSc thesis: Comparing flood susceptibility estimation methodologies
Hi, welcome on the Github page of my final MSc thesis. My thesis is available at [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2021/citg/waterbouwkunde/graduation-of-ian-mullens).

This page has been created to share the main scripts I created for my final MSc thesis with whomever may want to look into it. 
Be warned however, this code was written for short term use by only me. It is often badly commented and was not intended to be interpreted by anyone other than me.

The code is mainly written in python. I made use of Ipython files which can be interpreted by Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. 
Two notable exeptions are the statistical analysis, which has been done using the programming language R, and the (SWAN) flexible mesh creation which, has been done using MATLAB. 

I have catagorised my code into 4 sections. 
1. The statistical analysis, with which my thesis started. 
2. The code I used when using the spectral wave model SWAN (http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/).
3. The code I used for the 3 different overtopping methodologies. 
4. The code I made for the HEC-RAS (https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) inundation modelling.
